● Create a Aircraft class that has a fuelLevel() and displayFuel() method. The displayFuel() method should show the aircraft's new fuel level as well as return it.

● Create a separate class Bomber that can ordinanceDropped(), displayFuel(), and distanceFlown().

● For the ordinanceDropped() method, print out a message indicating that the bomber has dropped ordinance, as well as decrease the fuel level.

● For the displayFuel() method, print out a message indicating how much fuel the bomber has used.

● For the distanceFlown() method, print out a message indicating how far the airplane has flown.

● Create a BomberTest class to instantiate a bomber and display the distance flown, ordinance dropped, and fuel used.
