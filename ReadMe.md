● Create a Aircraft class that has a fuelLevel() and displayFuel() method. The displayFuel() method should show the aircraft's fuel level as well as return it.

● Create a separate class Bomber that can carryOrdinance(), fuelUp(), and fly().

● For the carryOrdinance() method, have it print out a message indicating that the bomber has dropped ordinance, as well as decrease the fuel level by 5.

● For the fuelUp() method, have it print out a message indicating the bomber's fuel capacity and increase its fuel level by 10.

● For the fly() method, have it print out a message indicating the bomber has flown a mission and decrease its fuel level by 10.

● Create a BomberTest class to instantiate a bomber and have it drop three things, fuel up twice, and fly once.
